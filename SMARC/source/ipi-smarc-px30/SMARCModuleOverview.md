title: SMARC moduleÂ®
---

SMARC (Smart Mobility ARChitecture) module form factor is the only computer-on-module form factor that truly is capable of supporting both ARM and x86 designs. With 314-pins on a high speed MXM3 connector, SMARC can fully cover both typical x86 interfaces as well as typical ARM type low level signals. Using ARM SoCs opens the possibility to leverage the product ecosystem of familiar devices such as tablet computers and smart phones. Alternative low power SoCs and CPUs, such as tablet oriented x86 devices and other RISC CPUs may be used as well. 

The Modules are used as building blocks for portable and stationary embedded systems. The core CPU, the related memory and support circuits are concentrated on the Module. 

The Modules are used with application specific Carrier Boards that implement other features such as audio CODECs, touch controllers, wireless devices, etc. The modular approach allows scalability, fast time to market and upgradability while still maintaining low costs, low power and small physical size.
Fast prototyping and Proof-Of-Concept implementations can be easily started by using the I-Pi or with our more feature rich Evaluation Carrier boards such as the [LEC-BASE 2.0](https://www.adlinktech.com/Products/Computer_on_Modules/SMARC/LEC-BASE_2_0?lang=en).

The module power envelope is typically under 10W and the form factor is ideal for applications that mandate designs able to withstand extreme environmental conditions.


*SMARC module is based on the ULP-COM form factor which was introduced by the companies Kontron and Adlink in 2011. During the specification process by the SGET the standard was renamed to SMARC module.*
