#### **Step 2**: Deploying

- Deploying on an Android device simply happens by clicking on APP icon on the home screen

- You need to connect I-Pi SMARC PX30 with android image by MICRO USB OTG cable to your host computer

- To get the application working, two files must be deployed on the target device locally which means, the files must be placed in rootfs of the device

  - [x] Application/**homa.cfg.sample**à /sdcard/**homa.cfg**


  - [x] Application/Assets/**AssetLibCff_Android_Target.bin** à /sdcard/**AssetLibCff.bin**

This can be done by drag and drop utilizing Explorer or by the **adb** command line tool on power shell

Refer the below image.

#### Installing App from Zip package

If you just got a ZIP package containing the APK (android application), asset file and config file, you don’t need any of the steps described before. You only need to install following files:

- homa-arm64-v8a-debug.apk

-         homa.cfg
-         AssetLibCff.bin

 You can do this by utilizing explorer by drag and drop, or much more convenient and faster by utilizing adb command on powershell

**Note:** If you experience an error like shown in following trial, try the **-t** switch 

<img src="Tutorial11-CanderaCGIStudioDemo.assets/Homac.png" alt="image-20201102150712556"  />

**Explanation:**

**-g**  : Grant all permissions during install (not important, just for convenience). If you omit this switch, android will ask you to grant permissions.

**-t**   : Set test Only flag to false. Only necessary if you face the mentioned error.
