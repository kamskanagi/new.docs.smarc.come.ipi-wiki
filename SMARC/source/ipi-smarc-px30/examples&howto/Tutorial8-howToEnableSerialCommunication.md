### Using Ubutnu Hevelopment Host:

1. **minicom** is the popular program to talk to the external RS-232 devices. Please enter the following command to install it

    $ sudo apt-get install minicom

2. After installed, please execute this command to open this program

```
$ sudo minicom -s
```

3. Set up the serial port connection( **The default baud rate for serial port connections is 115200** ) and save it.

### Using Windows Development Host

 Please download [**puTTY**](https://www.putty.org/) (**The default baud rate for serial port connections is 115200**)

## Serial port Connections

![image-20201102154524948](Tutorial8-howToEnableSerialCommunication.assets/image-20201102154524948.png)

There are four wires: red-power, black-ground, white-RX into USB port, and green-TX out of the USB port

**Note:** The red wire is not connected to the voltage as I-Pi is already connected with the power source.
